## Details
Please star if you fork. Bugs can be reported at [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeurvw-RTLQE7AeZkYAURFqvNZsXnOwBKGVhR-7bO_lHFGeDw/viewform?usp=dialog) or in an issue.

## Deploy on your own
_`package.json` has not be created yet so you cannot use Node.js and npm installation._

If and/or when we add a Node.js proxy, run this in a dev terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/phantomtax-ai/GamerLab
cd GamerLab
npm install
npm run build
```
or run [`install.sh`](https://github.com/phantomtax-ai/GamerLab/blob/main/install.sh). To run [`install.sh`](https://github.com/phantomtax-ai/GamerLab/blob/main/install.sh) run this:
```
# Open a terminal and run:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phantomtax-ai/GamerLab/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh   # Make it executable
./install.sh          # Run the script
```
If you want the files without the Node.js do this:
```
git clone https://github.com/phantomtax-ai/GamerLab.git
cd GamerLab
```
